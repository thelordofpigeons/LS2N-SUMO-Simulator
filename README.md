## Overview

This project provides a platform to:

1.  **Create Simulation Instances:** Define scenarios with a specific number of trucks, vehicle types, and mission sets based on map metadata.
2.  **Run SUMO Simulations:** Launch SUMO with the generated configuration using TraCI (Traffic Control Interface) for dynamic control.
3.  **Manage Truck Missions:** Assign and track multi-step missions for trucks (e.g., Go -> Load -> Park -> Unload -> Go).
4.  **Simulate C-ITS Effects:** Model the impact of specific Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) features, such as **smart parking availability checks** and **dynamic speed adaptation**, on truck logistics operations within the port environment.
5.  **Monitor Simulation:** Observe real-time truck status (location, speed, current action, waiting time) in a dedicated monitor window.
6.  **Collect Data:** Generate reports on vehicle performance, emissions (CO2, NOx), waiting times, and distance travelled.
7.  
## Features ‚ú®

*   **Graphical User Interface (Tkinter):** Easy configuration of simulation parameters (Map, Truck Count, Vehicle Type, Launch Mode).
*   **Instance Creation:** Generates SUMO route (`.rou.xml`) and mission (`.mis.xml`) files.
*   **Dynamic Mission Control:** Uses TraCI (`Starter.py`) to assign mission steps and react to simulation events.
*   **C-ITS Feature Simulation (Effects):**
    *   **Smart Parking Logic:** Simulates trucks checking parking area fullness (`isFull` in `Starter.py`) and potentially rerouting to alternatives (`getAlternative` via `myPyLib.py`), influenced by `mode[5]`. This mirrors concepts studied for C-ITS parking solutions.
    *   **Smart Speed Adaptation Logic:** Simulates trucks adjusting their speed factor (`traci.vehicle.setSpeedFactor`) based on downstream conditions (e.g., destination parking fullness), influenced by `mode[6]`. This relates to C-ITS concepts like Smart Speed Regulation.
    *   *(Optional: Add Smart Gate if mode[4] or similar controls entry/exit speeds/waits)* **Smart Gate Effect (Conceptual):** The `mode` string can potentially influence entry/exit behavior (e.g., via `mode[4]`), conceptually simulating the reduced waiting times associated with C-ITS Smart Gates, although the underlying document exchange is not modeled.
*   **Mode-Based Comparison:** Allows testing different combinations of simulated C-ITS features using the `Launch Mode` string, enabling comparative analysis similar to research methodologies (see Usage section).
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Separate GUI window (`monitor_gui.py`) displays live truck data during the simulation.
*   **Metadata Driven:** Relies on map-specific metadata (`metaData.xml`) for defining inputs, outputs, parking locations, stops, and mission templates.
*   **Extensible:** Designed to work with different maps defined within the `cases/` directory.
*   **Reporting:** Saves simulation results (overall stats, per-truck data) to CSV files.

## Prerequisites  MÔ∏è

*   **Python:** Version 3.8+ recommended.
*   **SUMO:** A working installation of SUMO is required.
    *   Download from [SUMO Downloads](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.html).
    *   **Crucially:** The `SUMO_HOME` environment variable must be set correctly, pointing to your SUMO installation directory (e.g., `C:/Program Files (x86)/Eclipse/Sumo`). The included `sumolib` library is used.
*   **Tkinter:** Usually included with standard Python installations. If not, install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu).
*   **(Optional) Azure TTK Theme:** If you want the specific GUI styling, download/clone the [Azure-ttk-theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme) and place the `Azure-ttk-theme-main` folder in the project root. If not present, the GUI will use the default system theme.

## Installation & Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thelordofpigeons/LS2N-SUMO-Simulator
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Verify Prerequisites:** Ensure Python and SUMO (with `SUMO_HOME` set) are installed correctly.
3.  **Place `myPyLib.py`:** Make sure the `myPyLib.py` file containing all necessary helper functions is present in the root directory of the cloned repository.
4.  **(Optional) Add Theme:** Place the `Azure-ttk-theme-main` folder in the root directory if desired.
5.  **Check Maps:** Explore the `cases/` directory. The `Nantes` map should be present as an example. Ensure it contains the required files (`.net.xml`, `.sumocfg`, `metaData.xml`).

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  **Launch the Main GUI:**
    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```
2.  **Configure Instance Creation:**
    *   Select a `Map Selection`...
    *   Enter the desired `Number of Trucks`...
    *   Choose the `Vehicle Type`...
    *   Check "Run infrastructure only" if needed...
    *   Click the `üöÄ Create` button...
3.  **Launch the Simulation:**
    *   Select the same `Map Selection` in the "üö¶ Launch Simulation" section.
    *   Enter a `Launch Mode` string (e.g., `Mode111`, `Mode010`, `Mode000`). This string is crucial as it controls which simulated C-ITS logic components are active within `Starter.py`.
        *   **Conceptual Link:** This mode-based approach allows for comparative studies, similar to methodologies used in C-ITS research (e.g., Bouazza et al., [Insert Year if Known]) where modes like `Mode000` (no C-ITS), `Mode100` (Smart Gate only), `Mode010` (Smart Parking only), `Mode001` (Smart Speed Regulation only), and `Mode111` (all combined) are compared.
        *   **Your Implementation:** Refer to the `Starter.py` code (specifically the `initMode` function and logic conditioned on `mode[4]`, `mode[5]`, `mode[6]`) to understand precisely how each digit in *your* `Launch Mode` string enables/disables the simulated C-ITS effects (e.g., parking strategy, speed adaptation, potentially gate behavior).
    *   Click the `üéØ Launch` button.
4.  **Simulation Runs:**
    *   SUMO-GUI should launch automatically.
    *   The "Simulation Monitor" window will appear, showing real-time truck data.
    *   The main GUI remains active. Console output from `Starter.py` will appear in the terminal where you ran `Main.py`.
5.  **Results:** Once the simulation finishes (all trucks complete missions or max steps reached), check the `cases/<MapName>/results/<LaunchMode>/` directory for generated `.csv` report files.

## Conceptual Background, Project Basis, and Future Directions üî¨

This simulator focuses on modeling the operational impact of selected Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) features on truck logistics within a port environment using SUMO and TraCI.

**Basis in Related Research:**

The implementation of certain C-ITS logic components and the overall mode-based comparative approach within this project were **directly based on and inspired by the methodologies presented in the work of Bouazza et al.** concerning C-ITS impacts in the Marseille port. Specifically:

*   **Simulated C-ITS Effects:** The logic simulating the effects of **Smart Parking** (checking availability, reacting to fullness, potentially rerouting via `myPyLib.py`) and **Smart Speed Regulation** (adjusting speed factors based on downstream conditions like parking status) draws heavily from the concepts evaluated in their study. *(Optional: Add Smart Gate reference if applicable)*.
*   **Mode-Based Comparison:** The core methodology of using distinct operational **Modes** (e.g., `Mode000` for baseline, `Mode010` activating only smart parking logic, `Mode111` combining features) to isolate and analyze the impact of these simulated C-ITS features directly adopts the comparative framework used in their paper.

*Disclaimer: While inspired by Bouazza et al., users should consult the `Starter.py` code in this repository for the specific implementation details and parameterization controlled by the `Launch Mode` string.*

**Foundation for Supervised Learning:**

Beyond evaluating the baseline impacts of these C-ITS features, this simulation framework is designed to serve as an essential **foundation for future research involving supervised machine learning** for optimizing port logistics operations.

*   **Objective:** The primary goal is to leverage the simulation to generate data for training supervised learning models. These models will aim to **predict optimal routing decisions or suggest dynamic adjustments** for trucks operating within the simulated port environment.
*   **Data Generation:** The simulator can produce detailed logs of truck movements, mission progress, encountered delays, traffic conditions, and performance metrics (travel time, emissions, waiting time), which can form the basis for training datasets.
*   **Initial Optimization Goal (Mono-Objective):** The first phase of this future work will focus on a **mono-objective** problem: training models to **minimize the total travel time or delivery time** for truck missions.
*   **Future Extension (Multi-Objective):** Subsequently, the research aims to expand to **multi-objective optimization**. This will involve training models that seek to balance minimizing travel time with other crucial factors, particularly **reducing CO2 emissions**, leading to more sustainable and efficient logistics strategies.

Therefore, the current simulator provides the necessary environment, configurable logic, and data generation capabilities required to develop and test these advanced, data-driven optimization techniques for smart port logistics.

## Configuration & Extension üîß

*   **Adding New Maps:**
    1.  Create a new subdirectory under `cases/` (e.g., `cases/MyNewCity/`).
    2.  Place your SUMO network file (e.g., `MyNewCity.net.xml`) inside.
    3.  Create a SUMO configuration file (`network.sumocfg`) pointing to your network file and any additional files (like `.add.xml` for detectors, parking areas, etc.).
    4.  **Crucially:** Create a `metaData.xml` file defining input/output edges, parking area details (ID, edge), container stop details (name, edge), and mission templates (sequences of L, U, P, G). Refer to the `Nantes/metaData.xml` and `myPyLib.py`'s `readMeta` function for the expected structure.
    5.  The new map should now appear in the GUI dropdowns.
*   **Customizing Missions:** Modify the mission templates within the relevant `metaData.xml` file. The `Creator.py` script randomly assigns these templates and picks random valid targets.
*   **Simulation Behavior:** Adjust the logic controlled by the `Launch Mode` string within `Starter.py`.
*   **SUMO Parameters:** Modify general SUMO settings in the `network.sumocfg` file for the specific map. Ensure parking areas defined in `metaData.xml` have corresponding definitions (e.g., in an `.add.xml` file included by the `.sumocfg`) and potentially the `parkingArea.capacity` parameter set if using the `isFull` check.

## Known Issues & Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

*   **External Dependency:** Relies heavily on the non-standard `myPyLib.py`. Its absence will cause errors.
*   **In-Memory State:** Mission progress is tracked in memory by `Starter.py`. If the simulation crashes, this state is lost. The `missions.mis.xml` file is *not* updated during the run.
*   **Hardcoded Values:** Some paths (like the SUMO binary in `Starter.py`) or edge IDs might be hardcoded. Refactoring these into configuration files is recommended for better portability.
*   **Obsolete Code:** `Launcher.py` appears redundant given the `Main.py` -> `Starter.py` workflow and should likely be removed or archived.
*   **Parking Capacity:** The `isFull` check in `Starter.py` depends on the `parkingArea.capacity` parameter being defined for parking areas within the SUMO simulation configuration.
